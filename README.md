# -Rock-vs-Mines-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression
This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to classify rocks and mines based on sonar data. The dataset used for this project is a supervised learning dataset, where each data entry represents various features of sonar signals, and the corresponding label indicates whether it is a rock or a mine.
